				<h3>AUGS: American Urogynecologic Society</h3>
				<p>In July 2014, the American Urogynecologic Society (AUGS) and the International Urogynecological Association (IUGA) jointly hosted their annual scientific meetings in Washington, DC at the Washington Convention Center. The joint meeting served as the largest venue for those in the field of urogynecology and Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery to come together for education, networking and sharing.</p>
				<p>AUGS-IUGA, two big names in the world of urogynaecology, have come together to make a potent change in people’s lives. We believe “Health Literacy” is essential for impacting societal health.</p>
				<p>Information is what educates the community and makes them strong. Here at AUGS-IUGA, keenly observed and highly researched health content is served to reach and give society a better perspective on their conditions.</p>
